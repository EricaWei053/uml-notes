# Unsupervised Learning

This git repository holds the scribe notes for lectures.

## Quick Usage

**Forking repo.** Create a fork of this repo by clicking on
  **Fork** on the top-right corner of the page. See also:
  [forking a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)


**Generate main.** Navigate to your local repository. In the root
  directory contains the shell script `make_main.sh`. This helps you
  generate the `main.tex` file for specific chapters.

```
$ ./make_main.sh
Warning: this operation will overwrite main.tex
Enter chapter numbers to generate: 1 2 6-9
Include parts? [yN]:

main file exported to ./main.tex
```

In the above example, this will generate a `main.tex` file that will
load chapters 1,2,6,7,8,9. Leaving the chapter numbers blank will
generate the whole book.

*Note*: you may need to give `make_main.sh` executable permission:

```
$ chmod +x make_main.sh
```

*Note*: if you cannot run the `make_main.sh` file, you can copy the
 `main.tex.backup` file to `main.tex` and make changes to the
 `main.tex` file manually.


**Making a pull request.** Once you've finalized your scribe notes,
  please submit a [pull request](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/) on github.
  We will review your notes, and if no major changes need to be made,
  we will merge your branch into the master branch.


**Compiling LaTeX.** We recommend installing `latexmk` (often comes
  with texlive), and running:

```
$ latexmk -pdf main.tex
```

## Organization

Here is the general shape of the tex-related files:

```
uml-notes/
|-style/
  |-preamble.tex
|-chapter_1/
  |-chapter_1.tex
  |-1_section.tex
  |-2_section.tex
  .
  .
  |-references.bib
  |-files/
    |-img.png
.
.
|-main.tex
```

Our goal is to reduce the number of conflicts: each student will
scribe on a particular section(s) within a chapter. For example, the
section on k-means is `chapter_1/3_kmeans.tex`.

The `chapter_1/chapter_1.tex` file combines all the section files
together. This way, ideally, only one student will be modifying a tex
file at a time. 


## Best Practices

**LaTeX** We've defined some commonly used macros below you may feel
free to use. Please don't edit the preambles before consulting with
us! Let us know if you need to import an additional package or think
we should include other macros.

```
USEFUL MACROS

PROBABILITY
Expectation:  \E
Probability:  \Pr
Variance:     \Var
KL Div:       \Div{}{}        % looks like D( - || - )

LINEAR ALGEBRA
Matrix (bf):  \mat{}
Vector (bf):  \vec{}

ANALYSIS
Abs:          \abs{}
Norm:         \norm{}
Inner prod:   \ip{}
Argmin:       \argmin{}
Argmax:       \argmax{}
Varepsilon:   \eps

COMMON SETS
Reals:        \bbR
Rationals:    \bbQ
Naturals:     \bbN
Complex Num:  \bbC
Integers:     \bbZ
Finite field: \bbF
```

**git** Everytime you edit any part of a line, git will save the
  change for the whole line. However, in text, a line could
  potentially be a whole paragraph. So, please consider turning on
  automatic word wrapping to help truncate each line at, say, 70
  characters.

In `emacs`, you can turn this on using:
```
M-x auto-fill-mode
```
In `vim`, this is
```
:set tw=70
```
